Overview
This Python script allows you to check the balance of multiple Binance Smart Chain (BSC) wallets. It reads wallet addresses from a file, queries the BSC blockchain for their balances, and saves the results in a new text file. It uses the web3.py library to interact with the BSC network.

Features
Batch wallet balance checking: Check the balance of multiple BSC wallets from a file.
Automatic wallet balance conversion: Converts balance from Wei (the smallest unit of cryptocurrency) to BNB.
Results saved to file: Saves the results to a text file (wallet_balances.txt), which can be used for further analysis or record-keeping.
Requirements
Python 3.x
web3.py library (to interact with the blockchain)
Access to a public BSC node (used in this script: https://bsc.publicnode.com)
Installation
Install Python 3.x if it's not already installed: Python Downloads

Install web3.py:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the web3.py library:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install web3
Save the script:

Save the provided Python script to a file on your system (e.g., checker.py).
Usage
Prepare Wallet Address File:

Create a text file named fresh_wallets.txt on your Desktop (or any folder of your choice).
Each line of this file should contain one wallet address (one per line).
Example of fresh_wallets.txt:

Copy

0x3ED0315Ac85F34c9D10486FF082230fED5d3D401
0x95230F4813417e09A40e4D11d19793068F7E4577
0x18535D9B93A9A5592Bd2FbB8bB5c059AEe0465D9
Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where checker.py is located.
Run the script by executing the following command:
bash
Copy
Edit
python checker.py
The script will automatically read wallet addresses from fresh_wallets.txt, check their balances on the BSC network, and save the results in a new file named wallet_balances.txt.
Results:

After the script completes, you will find a file named wallet_balances.txt in the same directory as the script.
The file will contain each wallet address and its corresponding balance in BNB (or "Error" if the wallet couldn't be checked).
Example of wallet_balances.txt:

makefile
Copy
Edit
0x3ED0315Ac85F34c9D10486FF082230fED5d3D401: 10.5 BNB
0x95230F4813417e09A40e4D11d19793068F7E4577: 0.0 BNB
0x18535D9B93A9A5592Bd2FbB8bB5c059AEe0465D9: 2.3 BNB
Troubleshooting
Error Checking Wallet: If the script fails to check a wallet balance, ensure that:

The wallet address is valid and in the correct format.
The connection to the BSC node is working (ensure the node URL is correct).
If using a different node, update the BSC_NODE_URL variable with the new URL.
Connection Issues: If the script fails to connect to the BSC node, check the internet connection or try a different public node.

Script Customization
Change File Paths: You can modify the file_path variable to point to a different location for your wallet address file or output file.
Change Blockchain: This script is specifically designed for the Binance Smart Chain. To use it with Ethereum or another network, you would need to modify the node URL and adjust the token conversion logic.
